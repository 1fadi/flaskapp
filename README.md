## Blog/ Social Flask app

### Notes 
Most of the code of this app are from the "Flask Web Development" book by Miguel Grinberg (great book, I learned a lot!),
some features in that book were outdated or didn't work so I implemented mine and added many additional features to the app and its models.

I didn't focus on the front-end a lot so Pull requests related to page styling and javascript code are welcome!

### app features
* login and register new user
* generate tokens to confirm account, reset password, accesss api, etc.
* create posts (title and body using markdown syntax)
* comment on posts
* upvote/ downvote posts and comments without refreshing the page
* edit posts/ comments
* delete posts/ comments
* follow/ unfollow users
* edit profile
* edit profile (admin access)
* sort comments by top or new
* timeline tab to display posts from followers only
* for moderators: disable comments; list comments from last 24h
* generate fake users/ posts/ comments and votes to testing purposes
